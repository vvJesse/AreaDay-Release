`cefr_j_v1_6.tsv.gz` is a normalized two-column extract of **The CEFR-J

The normalized file keeps only `headword` and `CEFR`, expands slash-separated
headword variants, lowercases them, and removes exact duplicate rows. No
definitions or examples are included.

`ecdict_exam_tags.tsv.gz` is a normalized extract of the `word` and `tag`
fields from an audited ECDICT snapshot. It keeps only `gk`, `cet4`, and `cet6`;
no definitions, translations, examples, pronunciations, Oxford data, or corpus
ranks are copied.

The repository publishes ECDICT under the MIT license and describes `tag` as
the space-separated exam labels `zk`/middle-school, `gk`/Gaokao, `cet4`, etc.
The source audit nevertheless records that ECDICT accumulated material from
multiple historical upstream sources. ResearchRamp therefore uses only the
minimal factual labels and retains the ECDICT MIT notice and this provenance
note in the distribution.

`ecdict_glosses.tsv.gz` is a normalized bilingual lookup asset produced from
ECDICT's `word`, `pos`, `definition`, and `translation` fields. It keeps only
dictionary entries with a Chinese translation, and truncates each displayed
definition or translation to one short sense. AreaDay uses it before
calibration to prepare local vocabulary cards; the original ECDICT data is not
queried at runtime and no user vocabulary is sent to a dictionary service.
