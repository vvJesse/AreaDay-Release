# Confirmed research profile

The agent creates this JSON only after asking 3–4 follow-up questions and receiving explicit confirmation of its plain-language research summary.

Rules:

- `clarifications` must contain exactly 3 or 4 questions that were actually answered.
- Generate 3–24 complementary search queries from the confirmed scope. This query expansion enables discovery; it is not a paper scoring or filtering stage.
- Derive the retrieval plan from the confirmed research scope. The agent owns providers, taxonomy IDs, search queries, and fallback order (after confirming the research scope, the user is told that they may leave the unattended task and may not be available for another technical-choice question). `retrieval_scope.confirmed` means that the plan stays within the research scope the user confirmed; it does not require a second technical approval round.
- The ordinary default is English-language public full text, the most recent ten years, and at most 10 older foundational papers. Adapt those values to the research area and the user's answer; do not silently impose them when the user requests a different historical scope.
- Choose OpenAlex with a configured API key, anonymous OpenAlex, arXiv, or a useful combination autonomously. Configuring an OpenAlex key requires user interaction and must happen before the unattended operation; without a key, continue with anonymous OpenAlex or arXiv instead of blocking. Keyed OpenAlex and arXiv are generally the more stable choices. Do not use Semantic Scholar.
- When OpenAlex is enabled, resolve one primary OpenAlex taxonomy boundary and store it in `openalex_primary_filter`. Choose the narrowest level that still represents the whole confirmed research program: `topic`, `subfield`, `field`, or `domain`. Multiple IDs at that same level are OR alternatives. Weekly and initial searches must send this as a `primary_topic.*` filter to OpenAlex; labels are kept so the host agent and the audit can see what was constrained.
- Generate 4–12 structured `arxiv_search_queries` only when `retrieval_scope.providers` contains `arxiv`. `phrases` must be established two- or three-word scholarly concepts, `categories` must express the confirmed disciplinary boundary, and `date_lane` is either `recent` or `foundation`. Otherwise use an empty list.
- Never use an unqualified `all:` query. The acquisition script searches each phrase only in title or abstract and combines it with the confirmed category and date boundaries.
- Preserve the user's boundaries and terminology. Add adjacent scholarly terminology only when it expresses the same confirmed problem.
- Do not set `confirmed` to `true` based only on the agent's own summary.
