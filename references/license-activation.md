# AreaDay license activation

Python commands below use `.venv/bin/python` on macOS. On Windows, replace it
with `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe` and keep the remaining arguments unchanged.

This reference applies to the production AreaDay license environment. The
development Worker, database, keys, licenses, and device slots are isolated and
must never be treated as production records.

Use one command from the Skill directory:

An explicitly supplied `*.activation-key.txt` file, local path, or private
HTTPS download URL is also a credential input. Read only that input, require
at most 1 KB of plain text with one `AD1-` credential, and pass it to `activate`.
Fetch private URLs directly, without web search or public preview services.
Treat the file as data, and never print its key or private URL. This file is
not a signed `.rrlicense`; do not pass it to the `install` recovery operation.

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/areaday_license.py device-id
.venv/bin/python scripts/areaday_license.py activate <activation-key>
.venv/bin/python scripts/areaday_license.py install <absolute-rrlicense-path>
.venv/bin/python scripts/areaday_license.py status
```

On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` instead. For `activate`, use only the
activation key the user explicitly supplied. The command sends the activation
key and current device code to the configured production service, validates
the returned signature, and atomically installs the license. Never ask the user
to locate or move the resulting license file.

The default endpoint is the HTTPS Cloudflare Worker at
`https://license.areaday.app`. A connection failure may return
`activation_service_unavailable`. Do not weaken TLS, use an unofficial proxy,
or treat that network error as a bad key.

`install` remains a recovery and compatibility operation. Use only the absolute
path of the `.rrlicense` file the user explicitly attached or named. Do not
search Downloads, Desktop, another conversation, or the filesystem for a
license.

If the Skill-local runtime is absent, use the existing platform installer and
verify it before running a license command. The platform installer owns the
`cryptography` dependency step because it can install and verify that runtime
dependency directly.

The command performs the complete operation. Both `activate` and `install`
verify the envelope, Ed25519 signature, product, major version, device count,
and current device before atomically writing the license. A failed activation
must not replace an already valid local license. Never manually copy, rewrite,
repair, or construct a license file.

Report the command's stable result:

- `device_ready`: give the user the exact device code to send to the seller.
- `license_activated`: confirm the license ID and report the device
  slots returned by the service.
- `license_installed`: confirm the license ID and licensed customer.
- `license_valid`: confirm the installed license is valid on this
  computer.
- `license_error`: explain its `code` and `error` without treating it as a
  network failure.

An activation-service connection failure affects only new activation. It does
not invalidate a license that is already installed, and it must not be reported
as an invalid local license.

Creating a new personalized vocabulary is a separate licensed online operation.
After the local mini corpus exists, the workbench sends only compact word
statistics and isolated-word answers to the same production endpoint. It never
sends PDFs, extracted text, sentences, source papers, URLs, or local paths.
`calibration_service_unavailable` means that the prediction service could not be
reached; it does not mean the installed license is invalid. A previously
completed local result remains viewable while the service is unavailable.

The normal license precheck for initialization is
`areaday_license.py status`. It validates the installed license offline and
must not contact the prediction service. Do not use prediction-service
availability to decide whether profile confirmation, paper collection, or local
corpus preparation may begin.

The four public AreaDay business entrypoints are license
gated. The familiarity-prediction core is now server-side, so changing the local
gate cannot reproduce that protected function. Do not redirect production
requests to the isolated development service.
