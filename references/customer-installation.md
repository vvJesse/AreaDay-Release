# Install AreaDay

The customer receives two separate items: one platform-specific AreaDay ZIP
and one activation-key string beginning with `AD1-`. GitHub's automatically
generated Source code archives are not installation files. Choose exactly one
AreaDay delivery ZIP:

| Customer computer | Delivery file |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 64-bit | `AreaDay-windows-x64-v<version>.zip` |
| Apple silicon Mac (M1 or newer) | `AreaDay-macos-arm64-v<version>.zip` |

Intel Macs are not currently supported. Do not give an Apple silicon package
to an Intel Mac customer; handle such requests separately.

The customer can send the repository URL, the latest Release URL, or the
delivery ZIP to Codex or WorkBuddy and say `安装一下`. The agent must read
`INSTALL.md`, choose the correct delivery asset when necessary, and perform the
complete installation. The customer does not need to choose among GitHub
files, extract a ZIP, move a folder, or run a terminal command.

The ZIP already contains Python, all Python packages, the spaCy model, and the
embedding model for that operating system. The first setup therefore verifies
and installs the included runtime instead of downloading those dependencies.
It is a Codex Skill bundle, not a desktop application installer. The customer
never receives or moves a `.rrlicense` file during ordinary activation.

## Manual recovery: Codex on macOS

Use this only when agent installation is unavailable. Extract the ZIP so the
resulting folder is `~/.codex/skills/areaday`, then run:

```bash
sh ~/.codex/skills/areaday/scripts/install.sh
```

## Manual recovery: Codex on Windows x64

Extract the ZIP so the resulting folder is
`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\skills\areaday`, then run in PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\areaday\scripts\install.ps1"
```

The setup keeps research workspaces outside the Skill bundle. It also copies
the exact former sibling `researchramp\researchramp-data` directory on the first
AreaDay installation when legacy data exists; it never deletes the source.
Upgrading the Skill therefore does not consume a new device slot or erase an
existing registry.

The installer retains the former online setup as a compatibility fallback for
old, platform-neutral bundles. New platform bundles use the included runtime.
When OpenAlex has not been configured, installation starts with anonymous
access so an agent installation never waits for private interactive input. The
customer may run the platform OpenAlex configuration script later to add a key.

For WorkBuddy manual recovery, place the complete `areaday` folder under the
user-level `.workbuddy/skills` directory instead. After setup, reopen Codex or
WorkBuddy if AreaDay is not yet listed, then invoke `$areaday` and supply the
separately received activation key. AreaDay contacts
`https://license.areaday.app`, validates the signed response, and installs the
license automatically in the operating system's application-data directory.
